Hi there! I'm Brian and welcome to my site. I'm excited to share my experiences and knowledge
on different networking technologies and network automation.

I have been working in IT and the networking industry since around 2002, focusing on in-depth
incident and problem management, architecture, and network automation. I have worked for some of
the largest MSP's in the world and currently find a home working for Optanix serving some
amazing clients.

Lately I have been enjoying using Python to interface with various network components to
help drive efficiencies in incident and problem management. I enjoy being able to
'automate the boring stuff' so that I can focus on the more difficult issues at hand.
